# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Jimmy Blain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glajummyb/), and I'm learning cloud technology for three reasons:

1. I want to stay technically adept as I grow in my career.
2. I want to have a base-level of salary [earning potential](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/atlanta-ga-cloud-architect-salary-SRCH_IL.0,10_IM52_KO11,26.htm) to secure my family's future.
3. I love technology and learning!

**Let's get this thing started!**
